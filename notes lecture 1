division by zero can leead to problems
doing things illegal in math cause problems in code

an integer and a floating number are not the same thing
when working with integers must be two integers result in integer
when two integers are divided the fractin part is cut off
solution use temperary type casting
double needed to store floating point value
double only has to be used once to make it double

    Basic input and output
both support input keyboard and output terminal
standard input for c is the scanf function
printf for output
f = formatted
with printf you hsve more control over floating point

    Java IO
for standard output you can use system.out.print or system.out.println or system.out.printf
standard input: use scanner
a scanner can read in from the standard input
system.in

convert a string to double: use atof()
if you want to convert to int: use atoi()
